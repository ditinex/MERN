2. Run "npm install" or "npm i" on the terminal to install the required node modules.
3. Create a new file .env on the root, copy the code from .env.example file to .env file.
4. Replace the DB credentials and add your name to the env variable NAME.
5. Now run "npm start" to run the backend.
6. If the database is connected you can see "DB Connected" on the terminal / log.

### Getting started with the frontend
